# Ronnie Antwiler
# 1.Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn
# Use iris dataset available in https://umkc.box.com/s/pm3cebmhxpnczi6h87k2lwwiwdvtxyk8
# Use cross validation to create training and testing part
# Evaluate the model on testing part
# 2.Implement linear SVM method using scikit library
# Use the same dataset as above
# 3. Compare the results and report accuracy, precision, F-measure and Recall

# Part 3
# 3. Compare the results and report accuracy, precision, F-measure and Recall
# The Linear SVM seems to score higher most times but there are a few times that the Naive Bayes. Also,
# the scores seem to be the upper 0.90s most times for both models. This would lead me to believe that
# the data set is easily separated or predicted.
